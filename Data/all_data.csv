APA will not stand for racism against Black Americans. “The horrific death of George Floyd has affected the mental well-being of everyone who has witnessed this senseless tragedy. When Americans are already suffering under the emotional toll of COVID-19, this blatant act of police brutality threatens to undermine the sense of stability of so many Americans,” Geller said. The APA calls upon authorities in Minneapolis to prosecute the officer who caused George Floyd’s death, as well as the other officers involved, to the fullest extent allowed by law. Justice in this case will be just one step in the healing process of this country.

The APA Board of Trustees has a long history of condemning police brutality, including two policy statements passed in 2018, condemning racism and police brutality. “The civil unrest taking place in America is a call to action to all Americans to address the longstanding racial inequalities facing the Black community,” said APA CEO and Medical Director Saul Levin, M.D., M.P.A. “Centuries of systemic and institutional racism toward Black Americans has led to decreased access to health care and multiple adverse health outcomes—as recently seen during the COVID-19 pandemic—in addition to anxiety and lower life-expectancy. We need to fight racial inequalities and discrimination that are life-threating to so many Black Americans. APA stands with the Black Community and all those opposed to racism to protect and improve the lives of the those who have experienced discrimination and the associated trauma.” The APA believes that all forms of racism and racial discrimination affect mental health and well-being and negatively impact the nation as a whole.

1,APA Div 28,7/2/20,37.0,,"Dear Division 28 Members,
Division 28, Psychopharmacology and Substance Abuse, values the lives of Black people and
their contributions to science and society. We are committed to working with other divisions as
well as with researchers, health professionals, and policy makers at other organizations to
eliminate inequities, oppression, and discrimination, such as those based on race, and elevate
Black voices and promote equality. The Drug War, which stems from the view of addiction as a
moral failing, has disproportionately impacted Black Americans who, despite using drugs at
similar, if not lower rates than White Americans, have markedly higher arrest and incarceration
rates. There are also racial inequities with regard to effective treatments for substance use
disorder, and Black Americans are particularly at risk for poor treatment outcomes. Black lives
matter, and it is time to remedy the negative impact that systemic racism has had on substance
use and addiction policies in our country and on the field of Psychopharmacology and
Substance Abuse in general.
Division 28 values diversity in its membership and we are now bolstering our commitment to
encouraging and promoting diversity and inclusiveness. In particular, we are currently
developing campaigns to increase the representation of Black people at all levels of Division
membership, from senior leadership to trainees. We are developing actionable items to make
these goals a reality, including fundraising plans to establish a diversity award and plans to
create a diversity column for our newsletter to promote and support our underrepresented
members and to highlight research on health disparities. We recognize that diversity of
experiences and identities bring diversity of perspectives, ideas, and approaches – which
improves science, scholarship, and public health. We believe that increasing diversity at
Division 28 is not simply about getting greater representation of minority voices over the next
couple of years – it is a crucial investment in the scholarship and careers of current and future
scientists who do work in Psychopharmacology and Substance Abuse.

2,Association for Positive Behavior Supports,6/12/2020 (need confirmation from Ronnie),17.0,,"Dear Association for Positive Behavior Support Members,
The international Association for Positive Behavior Support (APBS) condemns the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and countless other Black lives. We stand united with individuals, families, communities, and organizations across the United States and around the world demanding fundamental institutional change to end systemic racism, police violence, and inequitable treatment of people that have been historically oppressed. We fully support calls to action and protests to specifically and purposefully address racial inequities and the legacy of enslavement in our Black communities, with the ultimate goal of constructive change across our larger communities, locally and globally.
Our APBS mission statement explicitly promotes effective positive behavior support to achieve “equitable outcomes for people, families, schools, agencies, and communities.” Our core values emphasize a deliberate intention to create and support a culture that promotes the quality of life and well-being for all that is responsive to, and respectful of, each person’s human dignity and human rights.
What has this meant for APBS? In 2017, with considerable and deep reflection by the Board of Directors, and with input from our membership and our larger positive behavior support community, we established an ad hoc Equity committee that developed a definition of equity for our organization; collected data on ethnic and racial diversity, underrepresented groups, and access across our organization; and ensured diversity and equity content in our conference and webinar offerings. In March of 2020, APBS engaged in a strategic planning process that resulted in several action steps to further our mission statement and create more authentic representation of the diverse voices of our membership both here in the United States and abroad.
An important recent action that emerged from our March meetings is the addition of a dedicated Ethnic and Racial Diversity Full Board seat to further enhance our organization’s ability to achieve “equitable outcomes for people, families, schools, agencies, and communities.” This motion was unanimously approved by the Board, and this dedicated seat is included in the call for Nominations for this year’s election cycle for the Board of Directors. Candidates for this seat will be announced in the next few weeks, and we believe there is great interest amongst our membership to support this dedicated Ethnic and Racial Minority seat.
This creation of a dedicated, elected Ethnic and Racial Diversity Full Board Seat is not an isolated approach to further advancing equitable outcomes in our communities, agencies and schools. Moving forward, APBS commits to the following:
All APBS Board members commit to a self-study on racial literacy and bias;
All APBS Board members, elected and ex officios, as well as consultant staff serve through an equity lens; and
Anti-bias and social justice content and standards will be addressed throughout all professional development, conferences, publications, and committee work with proposals evaluated for the degree to which they address equity.
These strategies will further ensure that we are meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse membership across the lifespan, and across the globe.
We understand that right now many of us are experiencing strong emotions including anger, fear, and sorrow, and we want to know how to act in a manner that leads to desired, sustainable change. Our collective voice and action through individual member and committee actions at APBS can play an important role in the process of change. We welcome your thoughts, input, and energy as APBS members through general participation and through our committee structures to further enhance our impact and bring about true change and empowerment through our collective action. We stand with the Black community and will do what we can to create a more equitable future through our core values in positive behavior support.

5,Society for Prevention Research,6/5/20,10.0,SPR AND NPSC STATEMENT CONDEMNING RACISM,"The following message is being sent from SPR President, Guillermo Prado, on behalf of the SPR Board of Directors, and NPSC Co-Directors, Diana Fishbein and John Roman, on behalf of the NPSC Board of Directors.
Dear Friends, Collaborators, and Partners,
George Floyd’s death adds to a rapidly growing list of Black people assaulted and killed in the U.S. as a direct consequence of our society’s structural, systemic, and individual racism. Racial profiling and aggressive, discriminatory policing ranging from threats to lethal force are commonplace experiences for many Black Americans. The problems within policing are neither unique nor isolated: racism is in the groundwater of our country.
Racism impacts the health, mental health, and wellbeing of children born Black in America in ways that are evident throughout the life course. Black Americans are more often exposed to and at increased risk of death from the COVID-19 virus due to disproportionate exposure through employment in “essential” industries, healthcare access disparities, provider bias, and other structural disparities. These disparities impact economic stability, employment, food security, educational opportunities, housing and a host of other important contributors to health and wellbeing.
The Society for Prevention Research (SPR) and the National Prevention Science Coalition to Improve Lives (NPSC) recognize institutional, systemic and individual racism as a fundamental cause of disparities across all of society, directly affecting health, housing, education, employment, and equitable treatment of Black Americans. Racism, coupled with our ongoing tolerance for it, undermines democratic values for all people in the U.S.
As prevention researchers, educators and practitioners, we condemn the atrocities and pain that has been inflicted on Black people for centuries. We must call attention to the deep and indelible impacts of racism on Black Americans and other people of color while calling for change. This will require a coordinated public health effort as racism is a chronic and insidious illness that hurts all Americans.
We support the widescale implementation of programs and policies generated by the field of prevention science shown to ameliorate, challenge, and change system, institutional and individual level policies and practices that perpetuate and sustain racism. We are collectively committed to working with governing bodies and communities to promote the use of evidence-based, prevention science-based solutions that are community-led to ensure that all Black Americans and people of color live in a society that is fair, just and equitable. Prevention science investments in effective programs, policies and practices, and in training the next generation of prevention scientists and practitioners, will assure that we can all work together as a nation to eradicate racism.
With sincere commitment,

6,Association for Contextual Behavior Science,6/2/20,7.0,ACBS Statement on Racism and Violence,"“It is your duty to fortify your own house, so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organization. And now is the time to plot, plan, strategize, organize, and mobilize.” -Rapper Killer Mike, speech to Atlanta Mayoral Press Conference
ACBS is an international organization with the explicit mission of alleviating human suffering, so that we can contribute to the evolution of a more nurturing world. We are living in a time of profound global inequality. Many are struggling to survive while wealth accumulates in the hands of the few. Individuals belonging to minority groups are more likely to bear the burden of this inequality and suffer the most egregious losses. It is well-documented that for individuals who are racial ethnic minorities, indigenous people, members of the LGBTQ community, and women from around the world, the experience of racism and discrimination is associated with poor health and mental health outcomes.
We, the Board of ACBS, are writing this statement to unequivocally oppose structural, cultural, and individual racism, racially motivated violence, hate speech and all forms of prejudice and oppression in evidence throughout the world. We invite our community of researchers, therapists, and helpers to look hard at the many ways in which racism manifests in the world at large. We ask that our scientific community bring to bear the significant strength of contextual behavioral science in shining a light and exploring solutions to discrimination and disparities. We encourage you to bring your compassion, your openness to discourse, and your willingness to stand for communities and people who are discriminated against all over the world.
It has been said that to be silent is to be complicit. We intend to use our voice to join others in creating change. With this in mind, we make the following statement on the events in the USA.
ACBS Board Statement regarding the problems in the USA
Although our members come from all over the world, we as the ACBS Board feel we cannot be silent and must speak about recent events in the United States, in particular. This past week, George Floyd was brutally killed, in the light of day, while distraught onlookers watched, by police officers sworn to protect, and who instead ignored his cries for mercy. This incident is emblematic of the unconscionable, cruel, and unjust losses the Black community has suffered in the U.S. due to individual, systemic, and structurally embedded racism.
Mr. Floyd is one of many Black people who have been killed in the U.S. as a result of racism and discrimination. Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Atatiana Jefferson, Stephon Clark, Jordan Edwards, Alton Sterling, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland - the list of those killed without cause goes on and on, and is staggering in its implications. If you are Black and living in the U.S.A., you face a frighteningly high risk of being targeted and killed because of your race. If you are Black and living in the U.S.A. it may not be safe to go jogging, to go birding, to go to a coffee shop, to get pulled over, to stay home, or to demonstrate against racial inequity.
The people of the USA are living in what has aptly been called a “racism pandemic.” This pandemic has serious implications for the health of Black people and by extension, all of us. In addition to myriad negative economic consequences, racism is associated with poor outcomes in both physical health and psychological well-being. Parents raising Black children must send them into a world that is unsafe, unfair, and unjust. During the COVID-19 pandemic, data have revealed that Black and Hispanic communities have suffered greater losses during the than other groups due to underlying healthcare and socioeconomic disparities.
In recent days, we have seen international protests against the death of George Floyd and other victims of police brutality and racist violence. These protests have too often been met with displays of police aggression. Peaceful protesters have been physically assaulted with batons, pepper spray, and rubber bullets.
We, the Board of ACBS stand in solidarity with the Black community and all people of color, indigenous peoples, immigrants, the LGBTQ community, women, and individuals with minority status against all forms of individual, cultural, and systemic racism and discrimination. We add the voices of our organization to those who are calling for an end to racism, racial violence and police brutality in the United States and around the world. We acknowledge with heavy hearts the pain that the families and the communities of these victims are experiencing. We recognize the importance of reflecting on and ameliorating our own role in relation to perpetuating these issues, whether by action or inaction, and the importance of educating ourselves and others to address racism and inequality directly.
We know that this statement is not enough on its own and that this problem will continue if not addressed. We hope that our organization will be part of a collective voice that engages in sustained action demanding safety, justice, and peace for all.",1.0,"We invite our community of researchers, therapists, and helpers to look hard at the many ways in which racism manifests in the world at large.

7,Association of Behavior and Cognitive Therapies Statement,6/4/2020 (found on facebook),9.0,ABCT Statement on Racism and Discrimination,"The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies is outraged by the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others at the hands of police officers and broader law enforcement, healthcare, and many other societal systems that devalue Black lives. ABCT's mission states that we are ""committed to the enhancement of health and well-being,"" and our goal is to help those in need to heal. So, when we see a system designed to protect us, instead be one that kills, hurts, and disenfranchises communities of color, we are all the more enraged, troubled, and hurt. 
And we are called to self-reflect, and to act. 
As members of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, we use science to enhance health and well-being. The health and well-being of our Black colleagues, students, patients, friends, and family are repeatedly threatened and damaged by the systemic racism in our society. We publicly voice our support for social justice organizations, like Black Lives Matter and NAACP, who are on the frontlines, mobilizing for real lasting change in Black and Brown communities. We call on our members to use our science to help end racial injustice and police brutality, especially our members who typically shy away from this work. As therapists and researchers, we have tools and expertise that can help us work toward justice. As therapists, for example, we must create space for our patients to discuss racial discrimination if they choose, listening openly and checking our biases; as researchers, for example, we must work harder in authentic methodological design and recruitment to ensure sample diversity and inclusivity, and to improve our ability to assess racial differences. 
As therapists and researchers, we must also acknowledge our privilege and role within the broader system of generating and disseminating knowledge. We must commit to reflecting and exploring what opportunities we have had (and maybe looked past), and to use our privilege to address injustices and reflect on how we can actively seek opportunities. We believe the tools and expertise we possess grant us a privilege that must be acknowledged and acted upon. 
In 2019, ABCT launched a Task Force to Promote Equity, Inclusion, and Access. The Task Force surveyed members in March and April of this year, to assess members' opinions on how ABCT is doing with respect to equity, inclusion, and access. A detailed summary based on close to 400 responses was recently shared with the ABCT Board of Directors. Next, the Task Force will draft a full report, including recommendations for how ABCT can better support diversity and inclusion across everything that we do, especially supporting our members and stakeholders from the Black community. We also look forward to learning what resources (e.g., readings, educational opportunities, expert conversations) our members might find helpful for addressing racism and discrimination in their work, and to making these resources available. ABCT is committed to improving and growing, with respect to equity, diversity, and inclusion.

8,National Committee on Racial and Ethnic Diversity (NCORED)/ National Association of Social Workers (NASW),6/10/2020,18.0,Anti-Racism Now and Forever More,"We condemn racism. We condemn white supremacy. We condemn the devaluation of Black lives and Black humanity that pervades our society.
The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and countless others are rooted in these social ills and reflect profound failings on the part of institutions that are supposed to protect and keep us all safe. These tragedies are linked to a legacy of racialized violence in the United States that continues to plague Black people and Black communities.
As social workers committed to social justice and the dignity and worth of all of humanity, we recognize the pain, suffering, and outrage resulting from a long history of racism, oppression, and discrimination in this country. Social workers and other professionals across the nation are needed to address the inadequacies of our social systems in combating racism.
Injustice is never acceptable and we are called to fight it, especially within our own areas. The diversity in our nation and world delivers substantial opportunities for perspective sharing through cultural acknowledgement and acceptance.
In so stating, cultural competence takes into account the fluidity of our social system while it embraces cultural differences through all social interactions. Currently the insurmountable periods of distress calls for unity across the professional scope. Too often political systems, rules, and policies omit or disregard the necessity to embrace diversity and inclusivity. Cultural competence has paved the way to increased awareness, sensitivity, knowledge, and improved skill-based practice.
The time for advocacy to address the outrage and immeasurable dissociations is now. Social workers must strengthen our commitment to equity by reaffirming our fight to eradicate racism and all forms of injustices.
NCORED reaffirms our commitment to promote conditions, which encourage respect for the diversity of cultures including equality of opportunity in all activities of the association, with a particular focus on those groups that have historically been subject to racism. In this commitment, we acknowledge both the pain of racism and the work necessary to eradicate it.
NCORED is committed to advocating for reforms to address the conscious and unconscious bias in housing, employment, education, social welfare, child welfare, healthcare, mental health, and other systems in which we have influence as social workers.
We also want to recognize that people of color in our own midst — in our membership organization (NASW) — are injured and reinjured by the death of George Floyd, because it symbolizes the racism that so many of us have endured ourselves and/or vicariously with [and for] our loved ones.
As a Committee, we want to support each other, especially Black and Brown communities. We will continue our efforts to ensure respect, inclusion, fairness and equity in our social work practices and social justice actions for and with the individuals, communities and families that NASW members serve. We are committed to creating and sustaining healthy environments where Black Lives Matter and are valued and supported in all that we do as social workers.
Real change requires action. In the words of political activist, author, philosopher and educator Angela Y. Davis, “In a racist society, it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.”
As social workers, our professional ethical mandate includes being actively opposed to racism in all its forms — individual, interpersonal, institutional, and structural. Using the Standards and Indicators for Cultural Competence in Social Work Practice developed by NCORED as a framework, we propose the following resources for promoting anti-racism:
Being Anti-Racist (National Museum of African American History and Culture)
Reading List (Center for Racial Justice in Education)
An Anti-Racist Reading List (Ibram X. Kendi, PhD)
Personal Self-Assessment of Anti-Bias Behavior (Anti-Defamation League)

10,national association of school psychologists,5/29/20,4.0,nasp calls for action to end racism and violence against people of color,"Bethesda, MD—The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) joins with other organizations and individuals calling for action to end racism and violence against people of color, especially Black individuals, in this country. We also urge nonviolent, peaceful approaches that maintain both peoples’ safety and First Amendment rights. The recent deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd are horrific. They lay bare—again—the reality of continued systemic racism and our nation’s deeply imbedded inequities and prejudice that far too often end in unjustifiable, heartbreaking tragedy for a Black individual, their family, and their community.
We must stop this, and each of us has a role in doing so.
Advancing social justice is a strategic goal for NASP and an ethical principle for school psychologists who serve on the frontlines of advocacy for ALL children. The definition of social justice for school psychologists includes action to address systemic barriers, such as the long-term issues of poverty, inequity, prejudice, racism, and violence. We are committed to helping ensure that all children live, learn, and play in safe, supportive communities and schools with access to equitable systems, supports, and opportunities.
Schools play an important role by providing positive learning environments and the opportunity to process their understanding of perspectives and events in thoughtful and respectful ways. The fact that we are not in school physically does not change our responsibility to help children and youth see adults as keeping them safe and working to fix the problems that may threaten their well-being. We must also prepare for a return to school and the opportunity to work directly with educators, administrators, and all adults at school who are charged with providing a safe, effective learning environment for all youth.
School psychologists and other educators can proactively help students and staff in the following ways.
• Think critically about structures, systems, and policies that have historically marginalized some groups and caused long-term inequities.
• Recognize and understand the truth about racism and White privilege, and examine our own perspectives and implicit and explicit biases that contribute to perpetuating these systemic problems. 
• Speak up when we see someone saying or acting harmfully to others; name it as racism when it is.
• Establish the knowledge and systems to recognize and address acute stress and trauma in students and staff who experience or are vulnerable to racism.
• Advocate for and engage in frank discussions about racism and privilege, and provide students and staff tools to combat it.
• Teach and reinforce nonviolent approaches to bringing about changes in public attitudes, policies, and behaviors.
• Model civil discourse and provide opportunities to engage children and youth in conversations that focus on common goals rather than labeling groups of people because of individual behavior.
• Examine the mechanisms of power and punishment, and work to ensure positive, equitable discipline policies and practices in every school.
• Establish and reinforce trusting relationships among students, staff, families, community providers, and law enforcement.
• Ensure that, if law enforcement is present in schools, officers are carefully selected and trained, are not involved in routine discipline, and are evaluated regularly for behaving in ways consistent with training provided by the National Association of School Resource Officers.
• Advocate for public policies that address the destructive, systemic inequities of poverty and racism.
NASP has many resources to help school psychologists and educators engage in this critical work, including discussion guides and lesson plans on racism and privilege, guidance supporting vulnerable students in stressful times, and a framework for positive discipline. These are available at www.nasponline.org/social-justice.
As so many people have said in recent days, it is not enough to be angry. We can and must do better

14,apa,5/29/20,4.0,"we are living in a racism pandemic,' says APA president","High-profile racial incidents taking heavy psychological toll WASHINGTON — Following is a statement by Sandra L. Shullman, PhD, president of the American Psychological Association, regarding the mental health consequences of recent high-profile violent events targeting African Americans:  “George Floyd, dead after a police officer knelt on his neck. Ahmaud Arbery, fatally shot while on a jog. Breonna Taylor, shot to death by police raiding her home. Eric Garner, Philando Castile, Trayvon Martin — the list is far too long and ever growing.  “The deaths of innocent black people targeted specifically because of their race — often by police officers — are both deeply shocking and shockingly routine.“If you’re black in America — and especially if you are a black male – it’s not safe to go birding in Central Park, to meet friends at a Philadelphia Starbucks, to pick up trash in front of your own home in Colorado or to go shopping almost anywhere.  “We are living in a racism pandemic, which is taking a heavy psychological toll on our African American citizens. The health consequences are dire. Racism is associated with a host of psychological consequences, including depression, anxiety and other serious, sometimes debilitating conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders. Moreover, the stress caused by racism can contribute to the development of cardiovascular and other physical diseases.   “The impact of these repeated horrific incidents is inflicting trauma on the broader African American community. Research shows, for example, that compared with whites, blacks feel more negative stereotype threats and more racial profiling when interacting with the police.  “However, psychological research also points to possible solutions. Studies find that when police act in a procedurally just manner and treat people with dignity, respect, fairness and neutrality, people are more likely to comply with their directives and accept any outcome, favorable or unfavorable. “The American Psychological Association urges those who are experiencing trauma in the aftermath of these tragedies to practice self-care. Connect with family, friends and other community support people, talk about your feelings and limit your exposure and that of your children to news media and viral videos. Seek professional help if you need it. “As always, APA stands against racism and hate in all its forms, and supports the efforts of researchers, law enforcement, clinicians, teachers and policymakers to eliminate hate crimes and police brutality.”",0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"“As always, APA stands against racism and hate in all its forms, and supports the efforts of researchers, law enforcement, clinicians, teachers and policymakers to eliminate hate crimes and police brutality.”",0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,high-profile racial incidents take heavy psychological toll washington — follow statement sandra l. shullman phd president american psychological association regard mental health consequences recent high-profile violent events target african americans “ george floyd dead police officer kneel neck ahmaud arbery fatally shoot jog breonna taylor shoot death police raid home eric garner philando castile trayvon martin — list far long ever grow “ deaths innocent black people target specifically race — often police officer — deeply shock shockingly routine. “ ’ black america — especially black male – ’ safe go bird central park meet friends philadelphia starbucks pick trash front home colorado go shop almost anywhere “ live racism pandemic take heavy psychological toll african american citizens health consequences dire racism associate host psychological consequences include depression anxiety serious sometimes debilitate condition include post-traumatic stress disorder substance use disorder moreover stress cause racism contribute development cardiovascular physical diseases “ impact repeat horrific incidents inflict trauma broader african american community research show example compare white black feel negative stereotype threats racial profile interact police “ however psychological research also point possible solutions study find police act procedurally manner treat people dignity respect fairness neutrality people likely comply directives accept outcome favorable unfavorable “ american psychological association urge experience trauma aftermath tragedies practice self-care connect family friends community support people talk feel limit exposure children news media viral videos seek professional help need “ always apa stand racism hate form support efforts researchers law enforcement clinicians teachers policymakers eliminate hate crimes police brutality ”,0.193,0.733,0.075,-0.9953,0.294,0.596,0.11,-0.9958,0.193,0.733,0.075,-0.9953,0.294,0.596,0.11,-0.9958
15,abai,6/2/20,7.0,unknown - do we have acopy of the email subject line?,"Dear ABAI members and friends, We join with voices across the country and world in expressing our outrage over the numerous acts of racial violence that have happened recently in the US, including the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, among many others. We also recognize importantly that these acts are not unique to the US--racial violence and inequity happen all over the world and are most certainly not recent phenomena. There is a great need for change in our society and our world and we feel it is important to start with home--our collective home of the Association for Behavior Analysis International. We are committed to creating a more nurturing and welcoming environment for all of our members. We have a great deal of work in front of us, but we wanted to announce (and re-announce) some of the things that are happening now within the organization. Last fall, the ABAI Council appointed a board for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) whose charge is to support efforts to foster a climate of diversity, equity, and inclusion in behavior analysis and ABAI. The committee is comprised of some of ABAI's strongest, most talented forces for good: Carol Pilgrim (chair), Shahla Ala'i, Jovonnie Esquierdo-Leal, Elizabeth Fong, Wayne Fuqua, Ramona Houmanfar, Fran McSweeney, and Jomella Watson-Thompson. The DEI Board already has established programs to promote DEI for the ABAI community through an ABAI scholarship via a paper competition on DEI and an award for achievement in innovations in DEI. More on these opportunities will be disseminated as the DEI Board arranges the details. You may have heard about ABAI's first Culturo-Behavior Science for a Better World conference, which is set for October 7-9, 2020. This conference will bring together behavior analysts who are examining issues of culture with others from outside the discipline to exchange research and ideas that will help solve our cultural problems.
